**Due That** parses your class notes from Google Docs and finds the important deadlines, dates, and tasks you wrote in class. Maybe you jotted down a reminder to start that programming assignment this weekend. Maybe the professor mentioned a special presentation at the end of the month. **Due That** takes these snippets of text, parses them for information, and schedules them on Google Calendar and Tasks with a simple click. 

Made for Hackhers 2016. Built with Flask, LUIS (a Project Oxford NLP service), Google Drive/Calendar/Tasks APIs.
